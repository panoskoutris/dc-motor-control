# ⚙️ DC Motor Control

This repository contains a series of control system experiments focused on the modeling and control of a DC motor. Developed as part of the **Automated Control Systems II** course, the labs explore key techniques in classical and modern control theory, including:

- ⚙️ System identification from experimental step response  
- 📉 State feedback control for position regulation  
- ➕ Integral action to eliminate steady-state error  
- 👀 State observer design for output feedback control  

Each lab is implemented in real-time using MATLAB and Arduino-based hardware. The experiments are accompanied by theoretical derivations, control design, and performance evaluation documented in the report.

## 🧪 Lab Summaries

### 🔹 Lab 1 – System Identification  
Experimental estimation of the DC motor’s parameters based on step response measurements. Parameters include time constant, gain, torque constant, back-EMF, and friction coefficient.

➡️ *See Section: "Εργαστήριο 1ο" in `report.pdf`*

---

### 🔹 Lab 2 – State Feedback Control  
Design and implementation of a full-state feedback controller to regulate motor position using measured states (position and speed). The controller is tested under different reference values and conditions.

- 📜 `lab2_state_feedback.m`

---

### 🔹 Lab 3 – Integral State Feedback  
Extension of Lab 2 with dynamic state feedback that includes an integral term to reject constant disturbances (e.g., friction). The integrator improves steady-state tracking performance.

- 📜 `lab3_integral_feedback.m`

---

### 🔹 Lab 4 – Observer Design & Output Feedback  
Two parts:
- **Observer Simulation**: Design and simulation of a Luenberger observer to estimate unmeasured states. Analysis of estimation accuracy.
  - 📜 `lab4_observer_simulation.m`
- **Output Feedback Control**: Closed-loop control using estimated states instead of direct measurements. Comparison of system performance with different observer pole placements.
  - 📜 `lab4_observer_feedback.m`
